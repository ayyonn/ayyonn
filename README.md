  <p align="left">A pretty big project I'm working on is <b>Explore</b>, an app designed for travelers. <b>Explore</b> helps you navigate the big world with our maps, help you find nearby landmarks, restaurants, stores, etc, give you information on local events, built-in uber service and many more. Will be available on the web, IOS, and Android soon.

  All the other projects I create are just to practice with the skills I've learnt. You are welcome to look through them.
