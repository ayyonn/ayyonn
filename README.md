### 👋 Hi, I'm pm.
I'm a young UI Designer, Learning Developer, and a Aspiring Entrepreneur.
 
## ✨ So, what am I doing now?!
Currently, I am learning to Web Development with the Odin Project, and developing a next generation Discord Bot. Progress with the Odin Project 
is very exciting, and I highly recommend using it if you are looking to learn Web Development. I am developing Electora - The new and powerful Discord Bot. It's 
one of those Discord Bots that can help engage your server.

## 👀 Experience
My number one skill is UI Designing. This is a useful skill as it can help me brainstorm what I want my future projects to look like. I have only some knowledge of Web Development like HTML & CSS, but have at least a fair amount of knowledge of JavaScript. At the start, my way of learning was a mess, and I restarted everything with the Odin Project.
Also, gaming is probably one of the things I'm skilled at.
